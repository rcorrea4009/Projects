# Problem Statement

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early prediction of heart disease can help hospitals take preventive action, reduce patient risk, and improve decision-making.
The goal of this project is to analyze a heart disease dataset, build machine-learning models that can accurately predict potential heart diseases in patients, compare model performance, and provide actionable recommendations to hospitals for early risk detection.

## Project Tasks: 

1. Data Analysis: Perform complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset.

2. Model Building: Train multiple machine learning models to predict heart disease.

3. Model Comparison: Compare the performance of selected models and choose the best one.

4. Recommendations: Provide suggestions to hospitals on using predictions to prevent life-threatening events.

(Optional) Develop a simple UI for entering patient data and viewing predictions.


## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis

- Build ML models for heart disease prediction

- Compare models

- Provide recommendations to the hospital

- (Optional) Create a basic UI
